## Zones
### The Core
Introduction ? or perhaps the opposite

### Garbage Dump
Datatypes
A dump in the background with a shaky machine. There are buttons that makes the machine spit out boxes. These boxes have a value and color depending on the datatype.

type | color
---- | -----
? `void` | black
`boolean` | yellow
`byte` | pink
? `short` | orange
`int` | red
? `long` | dark red
? `float` | light green
`double` | green
? `decimal` | dark green
`char` | light blue
`string` | blue
? `object` | white

Boxes would just fall on the floor and get pushed into a tube to the next section.

### Get Sorted
If / else statements
A piston system needs to sort the boxes but is broken. By dragging code to a piston the piston will adjust it's behavior (based on color of the box on it)

### Recycling Facility
All about code reuse

### Assembly Line
idk yet

Classes ?
